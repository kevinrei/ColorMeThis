b. Brief instruction:
    Color Me This is a color detection application that aims to guide those who are colorblind as well as those who practice graphics design by determining and naming specific colors, their decimal values, and their hexadecimal values.  After opening the app, the user may either take a picture or upload a picture to analyze it.  In the event of a touch on the screen, a specific area or pixel will be selected, and the app will determine what the specific color of that selection is.  On top, there exists a menu that displays the About page listing the developers and mission, a Settings page to make various changes to the app's features, and a Palette page to save the user's favorite colors.
