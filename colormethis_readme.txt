Color Me This! Created by Andres Avila, Kevin Mateo, and Sydney Mercier.

Brief information regarding the application:
Color Me This! is a color detection application that aims to guide those who are color blind as well as those who practice graphics design by determining and naming specific colors, their decimal values, and their hexadecimal values.  After opening the app, the user may either take a picture or upload a picture to analyze it.  In the event of a touch on the screen, a specific area or pixel will be selected, and the app will determine what the specific color of that selection is.  On top, there exists a menu that displays the About page listing the developers and mission, a Settings page to make various changes to the app's features, and a Palette page to save the user's favorite colors.

Requirements:
- Although not necessary for the app as a whole, the app uses and requires the camera permission and camera feature in order to take pictures.  If a device doesn't contain any cameras, only the upload from file feature can be used to analyze pictures.
- The app requires permission to access the device's built-in gallery to grab photos.
- The app requires permission to write to external storage in order to save the pictures taken.
